# Backup Plugins #

This is a simple wordpress plugin that allows you to save **all** plugins, themes and dropins active in the current blog.
It's main purpose is to allow migration from a network install (e.g. because your super admin overstuffed it with all kind of b***s*** or because of personal differences with other users/admins/super admins) to a single install or another network (e.g. your own?)
It's not designed to be incredibly blingy, it will just add a page too your tools menu containing a lonely, single button so you can initiate the backup.
It will save a zip to your upload directory that you can download later.
